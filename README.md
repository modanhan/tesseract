# tesseract

Tesseract is a small single player battle arena survival style game using Aerobox for the Windows platform.

Tesseract is written in c++, uses graphics libraries opengl, glut, glm.
Project is setup and written using Visual Studio.

I already included all the required libraries that didn't come with Visual Studio in this project
(which is probably not a very good practice),
namely glut and glm.
So simply cloning with Visual Studio should already have everything setup.

I should probably mention that for some it might be required that you put glut.dll and glut32.dll in your Debug folder
where your executable is.
